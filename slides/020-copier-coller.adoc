This first option is by far the simplest.
Copy your configuration files in a git repository, commit and push, and you're good to go!

However, these are a few drawbacks to this method.

First, you can indeed manage your dotfiles, but can't handle installed software, you'll have to reinstall it by yourself and keep a list of what is installed.
You also don't really have an efficient ve rsion control tracking method, since you need to manually copy/paste everything.
This makes the maintainabil ity of this solution not too good, as you need to maintain two folders/repository to your professional and personal computer.
You also need to use another tool to store your secrets, since you don't want to store them in plaintext.

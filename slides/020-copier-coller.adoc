The first option is by far the simplest.
Copy your configuration files in a git repository, commit and push, and you're good to go!

However, these are a few drawbacks to this method.

First, you can indeed manage your dotfiles, but can't handle installed software, you'll have to reinstall them by yourself.
You also don't really have an efficient version control tracking method, since you need to manually copy/paste everything.
This cause that the maintainability of this solution can't be good, and you need to maintain two folders/repository to your professional and personal workstation.
You also need to use another tool to store your secrets, since you don't want to store them in plaintext.

[.notes]
****
French speaker, located in Bordeaux, working at Onepoint as a Tech Lead.

It's the first time that I'm doing an English version of this talk and my first English talk, please be kind ðŸ˜ƒ

My day-to-day tasks involve automation of various systems, working with Docker and/or Kubernetes.

As I was automating tasks for some of my work I decided to give it a try and do it on my own computer as well

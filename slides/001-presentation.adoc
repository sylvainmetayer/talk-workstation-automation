[.notes]
****
French speaker, located in Bordeaux, working at Onepoint, an IT consulting firm, as a Tech Lead.

As a side note, It's the first time that I'm doing an English version of this talk and my first English talk ever, so I hope your ears will get through this

My day-to-day tasks involve automation on various systems, ensuring deployments go smoothly and assist the developers team to push their code to production with less friction and effort as possible.

As I was automating tasks for some of my work I decided to give it a try and do it on my own computer as well

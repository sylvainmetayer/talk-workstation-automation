== Dotfiles, what are those ?

[quote,https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles]
User-specific application configuration is traditionally
stored in so called dotfiles (files whose filename starts with a dot).


== Example

[%linenums,shell]
.~/.bashrc
----
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if [ -f /etc/bashrc ]; then
 . /etc/bashrc
fi

export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/1000/ssh-agent.socket
# ...
----

> Others : vimrc, gitconfig, ...

== How to manage them ?
